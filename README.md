## About The Machine

The vulnerable machine I made is a beginner friendly CTF- machine. A CTF stands for Capture the Flag, a game in which players put their skills to practice to solve problems or break into an opponentâ€™s system. A machine with simple vulnerabilities involving Web Exploitation(Exploiting web page to find the flag) and Pwn(Exploiting a server to find the flag).

#### My Virtual Machine Setup
* I used the latest Ubuntu version(Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) as victim machine.
* Kali linux 2021.1 as attacker machine.
